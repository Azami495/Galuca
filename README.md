 This is the README for GALUCA
	Created by Luca Damasco
----------------------------------------
Galuca was created as a term project for Carnegie Mellon
University's Introduction to Programming class 15-112. It 
is meant to replicate the fixed shooter arcade game Galaga
(originally published in 1981 by Namco and Midway). It also aims
to allow user to customize their gaming experience by creating their own
enemies movement paths. Main complexities include
determining movement patterns of enemies based on the location of the 
fighter, movement of enemies in formation, and translation of user 
generated paths and sprites into functional game movement algorithms.
