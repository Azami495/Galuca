In class Player Testing Notes:

MVarner:
- Confused as to whether or not the "life" ships were actually hers or not. 
SOLUTION: Lower the images, make them a bit smaller. 

- Needs a "Get Ready" screen when transitioning between levels. 

- Needs a Reposition animation for the enemies. 

Idea for customization
Spline curve like effect which averages the points drawn to give smoother curves. 

DBasu:
- NEEDS GET READY SCREEN
This is a major problem with the game at the moment despite the fact that it's easily fixable. 

-Possibly add options for new ships at the start. 

SGoyal:
- GET READY SCREEN
- Also suggested curve smoothing for the custimization screen. 

Ftso:
-Also experienced confusion with life ships. 

-Also reccomended a "Get Ready" screen. 


Major Necessities:
Clear markings for when you can move. 
Make the fighter able to move between levels.
